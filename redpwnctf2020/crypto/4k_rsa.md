## Problem Statement
Only n00bz use 2048-bit RSA. True gamers use keys that are at least 4k bits long, no matter how many primes it takes...\
Attachment : "4k-rsa-public-key.txt"
## Solution
N, e, and cipher text of flag was given to us.\
[factordb](http://www.factordb.com/) gave us all 64 ptime factors of N.
## Flag
```
flag{t0000_m4nyyyy_pr1m355555}
```
